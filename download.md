Start easy and fast! 

The last Petals release is Petals 4.0.
Since this version, everything you need to start is contained in a single package. Or almost everything. 
The Eclipse environment for Petals ESB, Petals Studio, was not included to reduce the size of the package. 
You will have to download it separately.

<br />A maintenance version of Petals 3.1 is also available.<br />
[Download Petals ESB 3.1](http://download.petalslink.com/petals-esb-all.html("Browse Petals ESB 3.1 core and components")<br />
[Download Petals Studio 1.2](http://download.petalslink.com/petals-studio.html "Download Petals Studio 1.2")

Notice that in this version (and in previous ones), the core of Petals ESB, its connectors and transformation engines, as well as 
other development and administration tools, were distributed separately. Therefore, you will have to download manually every part you need.
