# <a id="sources"></a>Get the sources
As Petals suite is divided in many subprojects, history separated them on several tools. 
In the next months, we plan a full reorganization of our source code infrastructure around one central platform: GitHub. For now, use the following to check out our code.

* Petals ESB and components (current) - [https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/](https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/"Petals ESB 4.x and components source repository").

* Petals ESB and components (older versions) -  [Petals Link local forge](https://forge.ebmwebsourcing.com"EBM Websourcing's local forge for Petals ESB") and [OW2 forge](http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petals/"OW2's repository for Petals ESB") (some components/tools releases are on one or the another).

Note: as we have changed repositories during the history of Petals ESB, you may have to browse one or the other of the two hereunder repositories, depending on what you're looking for.

* Petals Studio - [https://github.com/petalslink/](https://github.com/petalslink/"Petals Studio source repository on Github").
