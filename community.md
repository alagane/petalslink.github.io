As most of open source projects, we set up several tools to help you explore and use Petals. 
Did you notice the navigation bar at the top of the page?

As Petals suite is divided in many subprojects, history separated them on several tools. 
In the next months, we plan a full reorganization of our source code infrastructure around one central platform: GitHub. For now, use the following to check out our code.

* Petals ESB and components (current) - [https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/](https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/"Petals ESB 4.x and components source repository").

* Petals ESB and components (older versions) -  [Petals Link local forge](https://forge.ebmwebsourcing.com"EBM Websourcing's local forge for Petals ESB") and [OW2 forge](http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petals/"OW2's repository for Petals ESB") (some components/tools releases are on one or the another).

Note: as we have changed repositories during the history of Petals ESB, you may have to browse one or the other of the two hereunder repositories, depending on what you're looking for.

* Petals Studio - [https://github.com/petalslink/](https://github.com/petalslink/"Petals Studio source repository on Github").

# <a id="commiters"></a>See who contributed
Since the beginning of the project, many people contributed. Petals Link employees, as well as some clients, partners, or simple passionate Petals users, combined their intelligence to build this platform, and we are very thankful to all of them.
