# <a id="repo-current"></a>Current Repositories
As Petals suite is divided in many sub-projects, history separated them over several repositories. 
In the next months, we plan a full reorganization of our source code infrastructure around one central solution: Git. For now, use the following to check out the code.

+ Source code for Petals ESB, Petals Components and Web Tools is located on Subversion.<br />[https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/](https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/"Petals ESB and components source repository")<br />Access is <i>anonymous/anonymous</i>

+ Source code for Petals Studio is on Git.<br />[https://github.com/petalslink/petals-studio](https://github.com/petalslink/petals-studio"Petals Studio source repository")

# <a id="repo-archives"></a>Old Repositories
These are the repositories to look for if you want to get source code for older releases of Petals products.

+ Source code for Petals ESB and Petals Components (<= Petals 3.0).<br />[http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petals/](http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petals/"OW2's repository for Petals ESB")<br />Access is <i>anonymous/anonymous</i>

+ Source code for Petals Web and Eclipse Tools (<= Petals 3.0).<br />[https://forge.ebmwebsourcing.com/](https://forge.ebmwebsourcing.com/"EBM Websourcing's local forge for Petals ESB")<br />Access is <i>anonymous/anonymous</i>
