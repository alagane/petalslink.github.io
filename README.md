# petals.ow2.org

> Community website for the open source Enterprise Service Bus, Petals ESB.

## Run

Download Jekyll at jekyllrb.com and run 'rake start'

## Generate

To generate the site, launch 'rake generate'. The site is generated under the _site folder.

## Deploy

To deploy to petals.ow2.org, launch 'rake deploy --user=YYY --password=XXX'. Ask the credentials to @chamerling if needed...
In the better case, the website is deployed automatically by a jenkins server and you do not have to do this yourself.
